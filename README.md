DOCUMENTATION 

DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY!

AS I AM REALLY BAD AT CREATING DESIGN FROM SCRATCH I DECIDED TO USE THE AI FOR HELP

THERE IS A NICE TOOL CALLED STITCH FROM GOOGLE THAT HELP YOU CREATE MOCKS FROM PROMPTS.

IN THE LINK BELOW I SHARE THE PROJECT WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE PROMPTS THAT I USED TO CREATE THE DESIGN:

        https://stitch.withgoogle.com/projects/4700401217738770621

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: I USE THE DESIGN AS REFERENCE, I DO NOT FOLLOW STRICTLY


ONCE I HAVE AN INSIGHT FOR THE DESIGN I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT A HIGH LEVEL ARCHITECTURE. I DECIDED TO DEFINED
IT IN 3 LAYERS:

    1 -  DATA LAYER: BINANCE API (READ DOCUMENTATION AND LEARN HOW TO USE IT FOR THIS SPECIFIC PROJECT)
    2 -  UI LAYER: COMPONENTS THAT I NEED (AND LEARN ABOUT FRAMER MOTION)
    3 -  INTERACTION LAYER: NOT ONLY FOR THE COMPONENTS BUT HOW THE USER WILL INTERACT IN THE APP (SEARCH BAR, ORDER ASCENDENCE AND DESCENDENCE, NAVIGATE BETWEEN PAGES, ETC)


FIRST LAYER: 
    TO RETRIEVE THE DATA IT WAS IMPORTANT TO VALIDATE WHICH ENDPOINTS ARE NECESSARY TO FILL THE INFORMATION NEEDED.
    IN THIS CASE I CONSIDER NECESSARY TO USE 2 ENDPOINTS:

    https://data-api.binance.vision/api/v3/ticker/24hr (TO POPULATE TABLE)
    
    AND
    https://data-api.binance.vision/api/v3/klines?{PARAMS} (TO POPULATE THE DATA IN THE CHART)

SECOND LAYER:
    AS EXPECTED, I NEED AN ERROR COMPONENT, LOADER AND AN EMPTY CASE.
    THE MOCKS GENERATED BY STITCH SUGGESTED CARDS COMPONENTS FOR SPECIFIC DATA AND A CHART TO SEE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE CRYPTO THROUGH THE TIME.

THIRD LAYER:

    THE USER CAN INTERACT WITH SEVERAL COMPONENTS BUT THE MAIN ONES (CONSIDERED BY ME) ARE THE TABLE (FOR PAGINATION), SEARCH INPUT, ORDER BUTTON (ASC OR DESC), MODE BUTTON (FOR DARK AND LIGHT MODE) AND THE CHART (CHANGE BETWEEN TIME FRAMES)


ONCE I DEFINED ALL THE THINGS THAT I NEED TO START THE PROJECT I PROCEED TO CREATE THE PROJECT AND INSTALL DEPENDENCIES


***IN THE CASE OF THE NEXT ROUTER PROBABLY IS IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT FOR A NEW PROJECT ITS BETTER TO USE APP ROUTER INSTEAD OF PAGE ROUTER, ITS CLEANER AND YOU CAN SKIP THE USE OF getStaticPaths and getStaticProps WHICH MAKES THE DEVELOPMENT WAY EASIER***


TECH STACK:
    - NEXT.JS 15 (APP ROUTER)
    - TYPESCRIPT
    - TAILWIND CSS (WITH DARK MODE SUPPORT)
    - FRAMER MOTION (FOR ANIMATIONS)
    - RECHARTS (FOR PRICE CHARTS)
    - BINANCE PUBLIC API (DATA SOURCE)


ONCE DEFINED THE LAYOUT WITH THE SIDEBAR, AND THE ERROR AND LOADER COMPONENTS ITS TIME TO POPULATE THE TABLE WITH THE MOST RELEVANT DATA WE CAN GET FROM THE API https://data-api.binance.vision/api/v3/ticker/24hr AS SYMBOL, PRICE, VOLUME, MARKET CAP AND A BUTTON TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE DETAILS


FOR THE DETAILS PAGE I DECIDED TO USE RECHARTS LIBRARY, I TRIED FIRST WITH SVG BUT I PREFERRED TO CREATE A COMPONENT FOR A READABLE CODE. I AM SURE THAT A COMPONENT AS THE ONE USED TO SHOW THE CHART IS MORE FRIENDLY THAN A SVG.

AFTER THE MAIN DEVELOPMENT I USED THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO FORMAT, CLEAN AND FIX SOME PIECES OF CODE. THE PROMPTS AND THE RESULTS CAN BE SEEN IN THE FILE: **cursor_project_type_definition_relocat.md**

WHERE I COULD FIX THE FORMAT NUMBERS IN THE CHART AND THE LIGHT AND DARK MODE ISSUE.

DARK MODE IMPLEMENTATION:

    THE DARK MODE WAS TRICKY AT FIRST BECAUSE I WAS GETTING AN ERROR WITH CASCADING RENDERS. THE SOLUTION WAS TO USE LAZY INITIALIZATION IN useState INSTEAD OF useEffect TO SET THE INITIAL THEME STATE. ALSO I ADDED AN INLINE SCRIPT IN THE LAYOUT TO PREVENT THE FLASH OF WRONG THEME ON PAGE LOAD.

    THE TAILWIND DARK MODE IS CONFIGURED MANUALLY WITH (@custom-variant dark) SO IT USES A CLASS STRATEGY INSTEAD OF MEDIA QUERIES.

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT:

    1. CLONE THE REPOSITORY
    2. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES: pnpm install
    3. RUN THE DEVELOPMENT SERVER: pnpm dev or npm run dev
    4. OPEN http://localhost:3000 IN YOUR BROWSER
    5. YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE CODE DEPLOYED AT: https://finsphera-crypto-app.vercel.app/crypto-market


FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

    RESPONSIVE TABLE WITH PAGINATION (10 ITEMS PER PAGE)
    SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY
    SORT ITEMS
    DARK/LIGHT MODE
    CHART WITH MULTIPLE TIMEFRAMES (1D, 7D, 30D, 1Y)
    STATS CARDS
    ANIMATIONS WITH FRAMER MOTION
    RESPONSIVE DESIGN (MOBILE, TABLET, DESKTOP)


FINAL THOUGHTS:

   THE AI REALLY HELPED ME NOT ONLY WITH THE DESIGN BUT ALSO WITH DEBUGGING AND OPTIMIZING THE CODE BUT AS I ALWAYS SAID, ITS A NICE TOOL BUT ONE DEVELOPER NEVER SHOUL DEPEND 100% ON AI. YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING.
